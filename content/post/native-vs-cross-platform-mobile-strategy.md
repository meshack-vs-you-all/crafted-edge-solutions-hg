With mobile traffic dominating internet usage, having a mobile presence is no longer optional. But should you build **Native** or **Cross-Platform**?

## The Cross-Platform Revolution

Frameworks like **React Native** and **Flutter** have bridged the gap, offering near-native performance with a single codebase. This means:

- Faster time-to-market
- Reduced development costs
- Consistent UI/UX across iOS and Android

## Focus on Retention

Our mobile solutions prioritize customer retention through:

- Smart push notifications
- In-app analytics
- Seamless user onboarding flows
