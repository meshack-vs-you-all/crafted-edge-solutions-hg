The **Crafted Edge Playground** is our dedicated environment for rapid experimental engineering. It hosts active, offline-hardened prototypes tailored for specific business sectors.

## 🚀 Live Prototypes
Accessible on the local developer network:

- **[Central Dashboard](http://localhost:1310)** — The jump gate to all active sites.
- **[Bakery Pro](http://localhost:1313)** — High-conversion retail/F&B.
- **[Construct Pro](http://localhost:1314)** — Industrial & Engineering corporate identity.
- **[Creative Studio](http://localhost:1315)** — Next-gen agency portfolios.
- **[Kenya Realty](http://localhost:1317)** — Real estate listing & SEO engine.

## 🛠️ How it Works
1.  **Selection:** We identify high-value B2B targets.
2.  **Mapping:** We map business needs to optimized static templates.
3.  **Prototyping:** Instant generation of brand-aligned, high-performance sites.
4.  **Audit:** Every prototype comes with a pre-baked SEO & Performance audit.
