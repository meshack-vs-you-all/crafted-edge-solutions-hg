## The Challenge

A growing fitness studio in Nairobi was managing bookings via WhatsApp, tracking payments in spreadsheets, and had no visibility into customer retention. They needed a single platform to run their entire operation.

## Our Solution

We built **JPF Stretch Hub**, a comprehensive business management platform that handles the entire customer lifecycle — from booking to payment to retention.

### Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** React with TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive dashboard
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework with Celery for async tasks
- **Payments:** Integrated payment processing with M-Pesa and card payments
- **Infrastructure:** Docker containerized, deployed on cloud infrastructure

### Key Features

- **Online Booking** — Customers book classes and sessions directly
- **Payment Processing** — M-Pesa integration for seamless local payments
- **Client Management** — Complete CRM with attendance tracking and history
- **Class Scheduling** — Instructor management and automated scheduling
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Revenue, retention, and attendance insights
- **Automated Reminders** — SMS/email notifications for upcoming sessions

## Results

- **80%** reduction in manual booking management time
- **95%** payment collection rate (up from ~60% with manual tracking)
- **2x** class attendance with automated reminders

## Tech Stack

`Django` `React` `Celery` `TailwindCSS` `PostgreSQL` `Docker` `M-Pesa API`
