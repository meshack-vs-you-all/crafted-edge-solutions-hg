## Our Solution: Automation for Kenyan Businesses

We specialize in helping Kenyan businesses bridge the digital divide by implementing AI-driven automations. Our **n8n Workflow Collection** serves as the foundation for these services, allowing us to rapidly deploy proven automation patterns for local enterprises that haven't yet reached their full operational potential.

### Helping You Leverage AI Operations
Many businesses in the region are yet to fully integrate AI into their daily workflows. We provide:
- **Custom n8n Integrations** for local and global APIs.
- **AI-Driven Operations** to automate repetitive tasks like invoicing, lead generation, and customer support.
- **Operational Audits** to identify where automation can save time and reduce costs.

We curated and indexed over **4,300+** production-ready n8n workflows into a searchable, high-performance platform. The platform uses SQLite FTS5 for sub-100ms search times across thousands of integrations.

### Technical Architecture

- **Search Engine:** Built with FastAPI and SQLite Full-Text Search (FTS5).
- **Automation Logic:** Standardized n8n JSON formats covering over 360+ distinct services (Slack, Stripe, HubSpot, etc.).
- **CI/CD:** Automated security audits (Trivy) and GitHub Actions deployments to GitHub Pages.
- **UI:** Custom-built, lightweight frontend with Tailwind CSS and dark mode support.

### Key Features

- **4,000+ Workflows** — Covering marketing, DevOps, sales, and more.
- **Instant Search** — Find exact integrations in milliseconds.
- **One-Click Export** — Download ready-to-import JSONs.
- **Fully Open** — Community-driven contributions and support.

## Results

- **Reduced dev time** — Saves hundreds of hours for automation engineers.
- **High adoption** — Starred and used by developers globally.
- **Low footprint** — Runs efficiently with minimal resource consumption (<50MB RAM).
