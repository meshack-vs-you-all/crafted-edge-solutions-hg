## The Challenge

Small to mid-sized businesses often struggle to implement automation because of the complexity involved in building workflows from scratch. They need a proven library of templates they can instantly import and use.

## Our Solution

We curated and indexed over **4,300+** production-ready n8n workflows into a searchable, high-performance platform. The platform uses SQLite FTS5 for sub-100ms search times across thousands of integrations.

### Technical Architecture

- **Search Engine:** Built with FastAPI and SQLite Full-Text Search (FTS5).
- **Automation Logic:** Standardized n8n JSON formats covering over 360+ distinct services (Slack, Stripe, HubSpot, etc.).
- **CI/CD:** Automated security audits (Trivy) and GitHub Actions deployments to GitHub Pages.
- **UI:** Custom-built, lightweight frontend with Tailwind CSS and dark mode support.

### Key Features

- **4,000+ Workflows** — Covering marketing, DevOps, sales, and more.
- **Instant Search** — Find exact integrations in milliseconds.
- **One-Click Export** — Download ready-to-import JSONs.
