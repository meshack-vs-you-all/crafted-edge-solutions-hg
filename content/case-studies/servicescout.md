## The Challenge

Local service providers in Kenya struggled to gain online visibility. Traditional directory sites were outdated, poorly optimized for search engines, and offered no tools for businesses to manage their presence.

## Our Solution

We built **ServiceScout**, a Django-powered platform that combines intelligent search, geo-targeted content, and SEO best practices to connect service providers with customers actively searching for their services.

### Technical Architecture

- **Backend:** Django with PostgreSQL, optimized query patterns
- **URL Architecture:** Canonical URL structure (`/service/city/area/`) for maximum SEO impact
- **Lead System:** Custom form handling with Kenyan phone validation and spam prevention
- **Admin UX:** Customized Django admin with filters, search, and inline editing
- **SEO Engine:** Dynamic meta descriptions, structured data, and sitemap generation

### Key Features

- **Geo-targeted Listings** — Services organized by city and area with canonical URLs
- **Lead Generation** — Validated contact forms with real-time notifications
- **SEO Optimization** — Auto-generated meta tags, proper heading hierarchy, semantic HTML
- **Admin Dashboard** — Full CRUD for services, areas, and lead management
- **Mobile-First** — Responsive design optimized for mobile search

## Results

- **2,000+** indexed pages within 3 months
- **40%** organic traffic growth month-over-month
- **Sub-second** page load times across all pages

## Tech Stack

`Django` `Python` `PostgreSQL` `HTML/CSS` `JavaScript` `Docker`
