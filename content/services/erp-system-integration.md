Efficiency in modern business operations starts with a **unified view of your data**. At Crafted Edge Solutions, we specialize in building the bridges that connect your Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems with the platforms your team uses every day.

## Eliminating Silos and Automating Workflows

If your CRM, accounting software, and inventory management are not talking to each other, you are losing valuable time and increasing the risk of human error. Our integration services focus on **streamlining your business logic** into a single, cohesive ecosystem.

### Our Integration Approach:
- **Custom Middleware & Connectors**: We develop bespoke API bridges using **Django** and **FastAPI** to connect legacy ERPs with modern SaaS platforms.
- **Real-Time Data Visibility**: No more waiting for end-of-day reports. Our integrations provide **live dashboards and analytics** that reflect your current business state.
- **Workflow Automation**: We automate repetitive tasks between systems, such as syncing orders with inventory levels or triggering accounting entries from successful payments.
- **Scalable Architecture**: We design our integrations to grow with your business, allowing you to add new modules and platforms without a total system overhaul.

## Tailored for the Kenyan Business Landscape

We understand that local businesses have specific integration needs, from **KRA iTax** compliance to local banking and mobile money reconciliation.

- **Local Payment Gateways**: Synchronize M-Pesa (Daraja) transactions directly with your accounting and ERP systems.
- **CRM & Marketing Automation**: Connect your customer data with platforms like **Mailchimp** or custom **AI Marketing Agents** to drive sales.
- **Logistics & Supply Chain**: Integrate with local delivery and warehousing partners for real-time order tracking and fulfillment.

## The Value of an Integrated Business

An integrated ERP is not just a technical upgrade; it's a **strategic business feature**. It reduces operational friction, provides actionable insights, and allows your team to focus on growth rather than data entry.
